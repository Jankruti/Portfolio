                        technology as well as entrepreneurship? Well, that's me! I'm Jankruti Brahmbhatt, a developer with a love for rhythm and
                        innovation. As someone who is passionate about
                        technology and its endless possibilities, I am eager to learn and expand my skill set. When I'm
                        not immersed in code, you'll
                        usually find me dancing my heart out or binging on my favorite Bollywood movies. I have a
                        positive and people-oriented outlook on life, which has helped me build strong relationships
                        with people around me. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges to tackle and
                        new technologies to learn, and I've had the opportunity to work with HTML, CSS, Javascript,
                        Bootstrap, Angular, Nodejs, python, and more throughout my career. I'm a graduate of Pandit
                        Deendayal Energy University, where I studied Information and Communication Technology. In my
                        downtime, you'll usually find me with my headphones on, lost in my favorite tunes. Thanks for
                        stopping by!</p>
