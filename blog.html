                    <h2>"Finding Balance: A journey of self discovery"</h2>
                    <p>I am Jankruti Brahmbhatt, a web developer with a flair for creativity and an eye for detail. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have experience working with popular frameworks such as JQuery, Bootstrap, Angular, and Node.js. I am also well-versed in Python. I used to think that coding was beyond my capabilities. When I started out, I struggled to understand even the most basic concepts. But through hours of hard work and determination, I gradually began to see progress. Now, I'm creating my own website, something I once thought was impossible. It's proof that with perseverance and a willingness to learn, anything is achievable.
                        However, coding is not the only thing that drives me. My keen interest in artificial intelligence keeps me motivated to learn and grow more every day. I believe that understanding the intricacies of these technologies is crucial to develop intelligent and efficient applications. I am not afraid to take risks, and I also know that failure is just a stepping stone to success.
                        <br><br> Apart from my technical skills, I am also a people person. With my communication skills and confident personality, I know how to build and maintain strong relationships with my peers. I love collaborating with my team members to create amazing projects that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.
                         In my free time, I love to dance. I believe that dancing is a form of meditation that helps me to stay fit and focused. From a young age, I was drawn to the world of dance. I am a trained classical dancer. I have pursued Kathak for over 7 years, and it has taught me discipline, focus, and perseverance. As someone who spends a lot of time working on a computer, I find that dancing is a wonderful way to disconnect and find my center.
                         With my positive attitude, I am here to make a significant impact as I will continue to learn and achieve great things.
